<h1>Welcome to UltraTube!</h1>

<h2>Things we did:</h2>
<p>- Builded an analog high-band UHF tv transmitter at channel 65 PAL-G.</p>
<p>- Builded The Atlantic DX transmitter</p>
<p>- Transmitted Atlantic 37</p>
<h2>Our ideas:</h2>
<p>- We will make a "incompatible" analog NTSC-M experimental broadcast with Line 21 captions called "Atlantic E". It needs to reach 500 ft. That's where a UHF TV Video Senders come in. model numbers include the WV-300 which was banned by government and infamous for finding those nowadays.</p>
<p>- Once we get an amateur license we will continue broadcasting those OTA channels or end up discontinuing them.</p>
<h2>Photos we have for now:</h2>
